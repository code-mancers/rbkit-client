# Usage

Rbkit client will be released as executable applications for OSX, Linux and Windows platforms.
The app can be opened simply by double clicking on it. Currently, you can download and try
the OSX build of the latest pre-release version from [here](https://github.com/code-mancers/rbkit-client/releases/latest).

Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcaYjiAIres&list=UUWnPjmqvljcafA0z2U1fwKQ#t=650) to watch a video of Hemant demonstrating some of the early Rbkit features at the RockyMountain RubyConf 2014.

# Development

## Requirements

You need Qt on your system in order to build the project. It's recommended to
install Qt Creator which is an IDE for Qt projects.

## Compiling on Linux

Assuming you have Qt 5.3.x version installed somewhere on your Linux box, after
cloning the repository you should run:

```bash
qmake
make -j4
```

And that should give you `rbkit-app/RBKitClient` executable, which you can
go ahead and run.

## OSX Yosmite  
Currenty there are 2 ways to compile rbkit-client on mac, with Qt Creator and with cmake.

1. Using Qt Creator
   Double click the `rbkit-client/RbkitClient.pro` file to open it in the qt creator. In the left menu-bar click on `Debug` button and select `rbkit-app` under the Run field.  
   Hit the Run button, after compilation the GUI should pop-up.

2. Using cmake
   Running a shadow build, i.e building from a separate directory is very
simple. Just create a build directory, say `~/rbkit-build`. Lets say
source code is cloned at `~/rbkit-client`

   ```bash
   $ mkdir -p ~/rbkit-build
   $ cd ~/rbkit-build
   ```

   Export `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.  
   For example, my `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` is:  

   ```bash
   $ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/Users/ishan/Qt5.4.2/5.4/clang_64/
   ```
   
   If you have both qt4 and qt5 installed on your machine, then run the following lines as well
   
   ```bash
   $ export CPPFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/qt5/include
   $ export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/qt5/lib
   ```

   run cmake and make

   ```bash
   $ cmake ../rbkit-client
   $ make
   ```

   start the app with

   ```bash
   $ ./rbkit-app/RbkitClient
   ```

## Testing Framework integration
Right now, QTest framework is integrated. So, if you make a build, then
tests will be built under `$BUILD_DIR/tests` folder. Those executables
can be run from commandline directly.

NOTE: For running benchmarks, there should be a file called `hugedump`
under `tests/msgpack` folder. This file is not checked in, because in
my machine, it is occupying 67mb. So, its better to keep this file
out of source control. For running tests, simply copy the file
`tests/msgpack/objectdump` to `tests/msgpack/hugedump`.


```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/rbkit-build
$ cd ~/rbkit-build

# in build directory, one can invoke qmake and specify cloned directory
# as source. This is pretty much shallow build.
$ qmake ~/rbkit-client -r -spec macx-g++ CONFIG+=debug CONFIG+=x86_64
CONFIG+=declarative_debug CONFIG+=qml_debug

# Makefile will be generated by qmake. Just run make
$ make

# run tests by invoking rctests
$ ./tests/rctests
```

## Debugging Qt Webkit applications.

After adding following line in code,

```cpp
QWebSettings::globalSettings()->setAttribute(QWebSettings::DeveloperExtrasEnabled, true);
```

You can debug js applications running inside Qt via simple "inspect element", like we do in Chrome or
other webkit browsers. Dead simple.

## Cleaning up build files
If you suspect that there are build files left over in msgpack and zeromq folders,
run this command to clean them up.

```sh
  $ git clean -dxf msgpack-c zeromq zeromq-4.0.4
```

# Releasing a new version

### Create a dmg for OSX platform
Update the VERSION value in RbkitClient.pro file to reflect the new version.
Run `macdeployqt RbkitClient.app -dmg` where `RbKitClient.app` is the OSX deployment
created by Qt Creator when you built the project locally. Doing this gives you
a `dmg` file.

### Tag and draft a release
Github allows you to draft releases and attach files along with the releases.
[Click here](https://github.com/code-mancers/rbkit-client/releases/new) to draft
a release. Releases always happen from the master branch. Tag the commit with
the version to be released. We follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).
Upload the dmg file on the release draft and submit.
